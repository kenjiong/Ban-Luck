## Description
Ever wanted to experience the thrill of your favourite CNY pastime anytime, anywhere? Now you can with this browser version of Ban Luck, or more formally known as "Chinese Blackjack"! The game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

I chose to recreate this game as although the premise of the game is inherently simply (i.e. getting your cards' points as close to 21 as possible without going over), there are actually so many different variations of it! The version of the game that I have implemented is based on the version that I play with my group of friends during our CNY gatherings each year. Therefore, you can view this game as a memory in a Pensieve, a small part of my life.

Enjoy :)

## Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here:
