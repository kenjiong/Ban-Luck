## Description
Ever wanted to experience the thrill of your favourite CNY pastime anytime, anywhere? Now you can with this browser version of Ban Luck, or more formally known as "Chinese Blackjack"! The game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

I chose to recreate this game as although the premise of the game is inherently simply (i.e. getting your cards' points as close to 21 as possible without going over), there are actually so many different variations of it! The version of the game that I have implemented is based on the version that I play with my group of friends during our CNY gatherings each year. Therefore, you can view this game as a memory in a Pensieve, a small part of my life.

Enjoy :)

## Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here:

## How to Play
### Start Screen

At the start, the player is given a balance of $1,000, and it is up to the player how much of the $1,000 he/she wishes to bet. The bet must be a whole number between 1 and the player's balance, and trying to enter a number which is more than the player balance or an invalid input (e.g. 0, a negative number or something else other than a whole number) will trigger the relevant error messages.

The game rules are also available for reading by players who may be unfamiliar with Ban Luck. By clicking the "How to Play" button, the player can get a rough idea of the winning combinations before diving straight into the game.
