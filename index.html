          <h2>How to play Ban Luck</h2>
          <p>
            The aim of the game is to get your card values as close to 21 as
            possible without going over or "busting". Each player starts with 2
            cards and can draw up to a maximum of 5 cards.<br />
            The values of the cards are - 2-10: face value / J,K,Q: 10 / Ace: 1
            or 11
          </p>
          <p>
            Players must end the round with a minimum hand value of 16, and if
            the player has an initial hand value of exactly 15, there is an
            option to run and not participate in the round.<br />
            Players choose "Hit" to draw another card and "Stand" to maintain the cards that they currently have in their hand.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>There are various game-ending scenarios:<br />
